# ARM #

This is a sample of some of the ARM programming that I do in my free time.  What
I would like to do is test how much faster assembly executes as compared to C.
The first way I would like to test this is to read a bunch of data into a linked
list and see how long it takes to do a bunch of finds in the linked list.  

All that is in my repository right now is just an ARM implementation of a linked
list and a node for the linked list, as well as some testing programs to test
the linked list and node functionality.  As of right now, the node is complete
and passes all tests, but the linked list is still in progress.

My priority right now is to finish the linked list, then create a
program to read data into the linked list from a data file.  A third priority is
to have more detailed documentation in the readme of this repository. :) I have
been working on this project for a bit on my own, and I am just finally getting
to putting it on my github account, so I apologize for the lack of
documentation.
